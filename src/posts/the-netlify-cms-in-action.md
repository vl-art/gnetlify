# Get started

## Static + content management = ♥

Get the speed, security, and scalability of a static site, while still providing a convenient editing interface for content.

## An integrated part of your Git workflow

Content is stored in your Git repository alongside your code for easier versioning, multi-channel publishing, and the option to handle content updates directly in Git.

## An extensible CMS built on React

Netlify CMS is built as a single-page React app. Create custom-styled previews, UI widgets, and editor plugins or add backends to support different Git platform APIs.

## Editor-friendly user interface

## Intuitive workflow for content teams
